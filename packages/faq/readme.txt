Q: What do most people with a CS degree do after they graduate?
Many go into the industry as software engineers (SWE), data scientists, or product managers (PM). Some people go to grad school to get a Master’s or PhD. If you get a PhD, you can go back into industry or can go into academia. Increasingly many Columbia students choose to start their own companies. As with all majors, many go into business roles, finance, and consulting. It’s important to note that while these are the more common career paths, a CS degree can compliment almost any career path or sector.
Q: Can I study something besides CS and still get a job in a CS-related field?
Yes!! Most employers care about what you can do, rather than what it says on your diploma. If you want to be a software engineer and you have projects to show for it, it’s very possible to find a job. It’s also very common for members of a CS-related field to major in  something like pure math, applied math, or physics.
Q: Do I need a Macbook to major in CS? 
NO! Any PC, Mac, or LINUX Operating System is perfectly fine. 
Q: How do I figure out if I will enjoy CS?
Try it! Take an intro class or work through some online tutorials such as the Python class at Codecademy to get a feel for what programming is like. Warning: it’s usually difficult in the beginning and has a steep learning curve, so don’t get discouraged. Stick with it for at least an entire course, or even two courses. Another useful of figuring out if CS is for you is to attend different events offered through the department or student groups on campus!
Q: I want to build an app or website, how do I do that?
There are many resources available for students that want to learn to build apps.
* ADI Resources (https://adicu.com/resources): ADI has compiled a list of websites and tutorials for learning different technologies.
* ADI Events (https://adicu.com/): Many of ADI’s events are focused on teaching web and mobile app development. Sign up for ADI’s newsletter to stay up-to-date.
* DevFest (http://devfe.st): Attend ADI’s one-week long workshop series and learn how to build an app for the first time!
* ADI Academy (https://adicu.com/academy): Interactive classroom style of learning web development. 
* ADI Labs (https://adicu.com/labs): A developer group that focuses on learning software engineering and app building.
Q: How much money can I expect to make in software engineering?
A six figure starting salary is quite normal. Check out the websites Glassdoor or Quora for information on salaries at companies. There’s a lot of information out there. In general, software engineering pays very well, both at the internship level and at the new graduate level. If you are concerned about financial security, software engineering provides a very stable lifestyle, both in terms of finances and in work hours (compared to something like investment banking).
Q: How do I go about starting a company?
Great question! You can find a comprehensive guide here. 
Q: I’m struggling in school. Is that okay? What do I do?
Yes, that’s perfectly normal. If you’re very concerned about your academic performance, you should talk to upperclassmen (maybe through ADI’s Cookies and Code) and TAs about it. Furthermore, there are help rooms dedicated to different subjects, such as the Math Help Room and Barnard Computer Science Help Room. Additionally, you can request tutoring from CSA.
Q: What’s the difference between Computer Science and Computer Engineering?
In the Engineering school you have the option of majoring either in Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Computer Engineering is a hybrid between Computer Science and Electrical Engineering and exposes one to both the software and hardware aspect of a computer whereas Computer Science allows you to dive more into application development, operating systems, machine learning, artificial intelligence etc.
Computer Engineering offers the best of both worlds if you like tinkering around with hardware and describe yourself as a ‘systems’ person. The best way to find out if you would truly enjoy this is to take an introductory electrical engineering class along with an introductory computer science in your first year and evaluate your experience in the two classes.
Q: What’s the difference between a track, major, minor, concentration, etc?
View all official details under the “Degree Programs” section of the Computer Science Department’s website here: http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/undergrad 
A major refers to what you will receive your B.A. or B.S. in at graduation. SEAS students receive a B.S., and CC, GS, and Barnard students receive a B.A.
A track is a focus for your CS major. There are seven main tracks within the CS major to focus your studies, and you need to fulfill one of them to receive your major. There is overlap between many of the tracks.
A concentration is a reduction of a major that you can receive if you are in Columbia College. You can graduate with just a concentration, or do a concentration in Computer Science with a major or concentration in another field.
A minor is a set of courses smaller than a major that covers a secondary area of study. Minors are only available to SEAS students.
A double major is when you complete the full requirements for two majors in your four years at Columbia. It is difficult (but not impossible!) to double major in SEAS, so most double majors are in CC, GS, or BC.
Q: When do I need to pick a track?
It is useful to have chosen a track by Junior year, but it is perfectly acceptable to wait until Senior year to commit. Most students have a general idea by the end of their sophomore year which track they are interested in doing, based on the classes they have taken and enjoyed. Because all CS majors are required to take five technical electives as a part of their major, you can explore taking a wide variety of classes before picking your track. Don’t worry about specializing too early!
Q: Is it a good idea to load up on CS classes?
You should take a course load that you feel you can handle! This will vary by person and will likely change as you take more CS courses. It may be difficult to take Advanced Programming and Data Structures concurrently as a Sophomore but feel reasonable to take three 4000 level CS courses as a senior. As a general rule of thumb, 2 technical classes a semester should be manageable.
Q: To do well as a CS major, did I have to study computer science in high school?
NO! This is probably one the biggest misconceptions about Computer Science in college. For the first semester or two, having studied Computer Science in high school will make some classes easier, but after your first year it’s all a wash. There are many successful CS majors that took their first CS course at Columbia.
Q: I’m not sure about majoring in Computer Science. Can I switch into the major later in my college career?
Definitely. Many students switch into the major their Sophomore years and a few successfully complete the program after switching in their Junior years.  However, these students have busier schedules and are not able to explore as many technical electives.
Q: How much does GPA matter? What’s a “good” GPA?
In the tech industry, a good GPA and credentialing in general, while very helpful, are not necessarily required to be a successful candidate for many positions in industry. Generally speaking startups are less concerned with your academic credentials and will be more interested in what you can actually build.
Your grades and proof academic rigor become more important if you are considering graduate programs and further academic education. In other industries such as consulting and finance, maintaining a high GPA is quite important for success in the recruiting process.
Q: Who is my CS Advisor?
This information is always available here.  
Q: Who are the best professors?
Unfortunately there’s no concrete answer to this question. People learn well from different professors with different lecture or class styles. If you want student perspectives on a certain professor though, feel free to join the Columbia Computer Science Facebook group and ask!
Q: I’m not in SEAS, can I still take all the same Computer Science classes? 
Yes! SEAS, CC, BC, and GS students can all take all CS department classes, so long as you are a major/concentrator.
Q: Should I skip out of 1004/1007 and go directly to 3134?
If you come into college with a 5 on AP Computer Science and were programming in high school, you have the option to skip out of 1004. The CS department recommends that you still take 1007 to bridge your high school and college computer science course load, but ultimately the decision is yours.
But if you’re comfortable programming with Java, typically with codebases spanning a few hundred lines of code, you may place directly into 3134 with the appropriate approval.
Q: What order should I take the CS requirements in?
You should start with an intro class like 1004 or 1007. If you’ve taken a class in programming before, consider taking 1007. Then, move on to the CS Core, but don’t feel pressured to finish it before branching out. In general, it’s best practice to take Data Structures and Advanced Programming, as well as any specific prerequisites before taking upper level (4000 level and above) classes. You can find the Columbia CS bulletin here. 
Q: Can I take Discrete Math before, during, or after Data Structures?
The bulletin advises that you take Discrete Math (COMS W3203) and Data Structures (COMS W3134/3137) during the fall semester of your sophomore year.  However, it is more than acceptable to take them during different semesters, so long as you have the appropriate pre-requisites. 
Q: Do I need to take *insert prerequisite course* prior to *insert COMS course*? 
If a course is listed as a prerequisite, then you should assume the content of that prerequisite is necessary for success in that course. If you’re confident in your knowledge of the prerequisite material, then go ahead and take the course. The CS Department will not prevent you from registering; however, note, that if it’s a required CS degree requirement, you will likely have to take that prerequisite course at some point in your Columbia career anyway. In these cases, you should consult your CS advisor.
Q: Should I take Machine Learning (COMS W4771) or Statistical Machine Learning (STAT W4400)? 
It depends on your interests! COMS W4771 focuses more on the implementation of Machine Learning algorithms, whereas STAT 4400 is more focused on the mathematical concepts behind these algorithms. If you’re looking to have STAT W4400 replace your COMS W4771 Computer Science degree requirement, consult with your advisor for approval first. Generally speaking, Intelligence Systems Track students cannot substitute while other Track students can. 
Q: What’s an internship?
An internship is a fixed-term job at a company for potential employees. In tech unlike in many other industries, most internships are paid positions. Many students choose to pursue internships as early as their first-year summer, and some students do internships during the school year as well. Research is popular alternative to an internship in industry, and some students find such opportunities more accessible their first-year summer.
It is common not to do an internship during your first-year summer, but doing so is often very rewarding and may help with other opportunities down the line. 
Q: What classes should I take to prepare for a software engineering internship?
Most internships do not expect you to know much outside of data structures and algorithms and being able to think through a problem. However, starting an internship with prior knowledge may give you the opportunity to take on more advanced projects which could yield a better experience.
Depending on the type of company that you’re interning at, different classes may give you more relevant information. You should take the classes that you are interested in and try to get an internship in that area of study.
That being said, most companies do expect you to be proficient with data structures and algorithms during the interview process, so you should take Data Structures and Algorithms (COMS W3134 / W3137) and Analysis of Algorithms in preparation for interviews.
Q: How should I prepare for interviews?
* Take Data Structures early, or read Cracking the Coding Interview (a book covering data structures and algorithms) - it's extremely useful for most interviews.
* Mock interviews are extremely important! It takes time to get used to vocalizing your thoughts while you code, so practicing with friends before the actual interview will be helpful. It is especially helpful to practice with people you do not know as well, since that simulates the dynamic with an interviewer a bit better.
* Prepare for the non-technical questions beforehand as well - be sure you can talk about your resume, what areas of CS you're most interested in, and why you want to work at the company you're interviewing for. Also, come up with a few questions to ask your interviewer to show your interest in the company!
* Some questions you might want to ask, curated by Stripe engineer Julia Evans: http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/ 
* Don't be discouraged if you bomb your first interview. It happens to everyone, and you can only improve from there!
* Check out these resources for practicing:
   * ADI Interview Prep Help: https://github.com/adicu/interview_help 
   * Interview Prep Github Repo: https://github.com/derekargueta/Interview-Prep 
   * Data Structures Workshop: http://www.raymondxu.io/datastructures.pdf 
Q: How do I find out about internships other than through Handshake?
Talk to upperclassmen and professors: Talk to your TAs and professors, as well as upperclassmen that you can find through student groups on campus. For example, go to Cookies and Code (by ADI) and just ask someone!
Recruiting events on campus: Many companies will hold recruiting events on campus throughout the year (especially larger ones). Keep on the lookout for these events coming to campus. Announcements will usually go out on the CS department mailing list, or through the communications of a student group.
ADI’s Startup Career Fair: Every fall, ADI brings a bunch of startups to campus for a career fair. It’s casual (don’t wear a suit!) and is a great way to meet smaller companies that don’t have the ability to run events on campus or attend a Columbia career fair
Columbia career fairs: Columbia holds career fairs for both CC and SEAS. Look online to find the dates for them. It’s relatively difficult to get noticed as a first-year, but it’s not impossible! Expect to wear business formal attire.
Company Websites: If you want to work for a company, go to the jobs or careers page on their website to find out the best way to contact them! Usually, another method is preferred, but if all else fails definitely do this.
CS Undergrad Listserv: The CS department has an undergraduate listserv with very frequent job postings from companies who’ve reached out to the CS department directly (in addition to the occasional report of free pizza). Email Kathryn Angeles <kangeles@cs.columbia.edu> to get on the listserv.
Q: How does the process for applying to an internship work?
1. Introduction: Either you apply for the job, are introduced to a recruiter, or do a programming challenge that they post on their website.
2. Phone/Skype Interview: You hop on a phone call with an engineer, where they’ll ask you questions - some about your experience, and others to test your technical abilities. Often, you will be asked to write code in some shared online editor and talk through solving a problem (like Coderpad).
3. More Phone/Skype Interviews: Depending on the company, the number of phone interviews will vary.
4. Onsite Interviews (sometimes): If the company does onsite interviews, you will be invited to come to their office to meet engineers and other team members. There will be in-person coding interviews which may involve coding on a whiteboard, as well an opportunity for you to socialize with the team members and learn more about what it’s like to work at the company.
Q: What are some internship programs first-years can apply to?
* Google Engineering Practicum: This is Google’s software engineering internship for first-years and sophomores. 
* Facebook University: Sometimes called FBU, this program is an internship exclusively for first-years that includes a multi-week tutorial in mobile app development. The FBU Engineering program is the biggest, but in recent years it has expanded into FBU Analytics, FBU Product Design, and FBU Business programs.
* Code2040: A program for Black and Latinx engineers that pairs students with jobs in the tech industry.
* Microsoft Explore/Foundry Internship: Microsoft also has a program that helps first-years and sophomores get exposed to software engineering. The Foundry program is based on working on building and shipping a product with other interns in a team that includes developers, designers, and product managers.
* Qualcomm Early Identification Program: This program offers opportunities in Systems, Hardware, and Software Engineering. 
* hackNY Fellows: This program pairs students with startups to provide a strong mentoring environment.
* Freshman Sophomore Year Internship: This is TwoSigma’s software engineering internship for first-years.
Q: How do I get the attention of a recruiter?
* Go to on-campus events by companies (they’re always for recruiting)
* Talking to employees is great at career fairs, but always talk to the recruiters!
* Go to hackathons, and speak to recruiters there, try learning new skills from people around you.
* Be creative - use your connections, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. to get in touch!
Q: How do I get a research position?
Most undergraduate research assistants simply emailed professors they were interested in working with. There are options beyond just “cold emailing” professors and hoping for the best, but this is definitely one that hasn’t failed many students before. With that said, let’s go over in detail how that process looks like. For reference, you can find a list of professors and their research at http://engineering.columbia.edu/opportunities#cs or http://www.cs.columbia.edu/research/labs. 
Additionally, as has been mentioned in this guide before, you should add yourself to the CS listservs. Email Kathryn Angeles <kangeles@cs.columbia.edu> to have yourself added for possible opportunities. In the beginning of each semester, the CS Department has a research symposium where the current projects going on our presented. A great way to get research is to attend this and follow up with a project you really liked.
Q: What kind of experience do I need to do research?
If you’re looking to do research in the computer science department, you should probably have some experience programming, whether that be from a class you took at Columbia or otherwise. With that said, the more courses you have taken, the easier it will be for you find a professor to do research with. However, if you’re just beginning out in your computer science education, fear not - there are still opportunities for you out there. As long as you’re comfortable with one programming language and genuinely want to do research, you should absolutely go for it. 
With that said, depending on the subfield of computer science research is what classes you should have taken or be taking to participate in research. You can usually find prerequisites in the lab description. If you’re not sure of what these prerequisites are, feel free to ask your advisor or a professor. 
Q: How much of a time commitment is research?
If you choose to do research during the academic year, be aware that most labs ask students to allocate 10-15 hours a week so keep in mind your other commitments before deciding if this is something you want to do. While there are many students that only choose to engage in research during the summer, the positive aspect of working at a lab continuously is the opportunity to get your name published in a paper. Another aspect is that most professors are comfortable with letting you work according to a schedule that aligns with your midterms and other commitments, provided you catch up on that afterwards. 
Q: How do I reach out to a professor?
Contacting a professor for research can be intimidating, especially if you have no idea how to go about doing so. With that said, here are some useful tips for the initial email to a professor:
* It’s very important that you introduce yourself, your school standing, major, and why you’re emailing them right off the bat, so include that in your first paragraph.
* Be as specific and genuine as possible in your reasoning for wanting to work in your lab- professors want people who are interested in their research because those are the people most likely to make a solid contribution. Being too vague won’t really get you anywhere.
* Include a brief commentary on your skills- enough to get them the big picture, but small enough that they won’t get annoyed since you’ll be attaching your resume. 
* Let them know what makes you awesome. Also, offering to learn material on your own shows you’re not only dedicated, but you’re in it for more than just a resume builder. Of course, don’t say you’re willing to do x, y, or z if you’re not. 
* Additionally, don’t lie if you’re not interested in a long-term commitment, but if you are, let them know. Professors love to keep students around for a long period of time.
* Asking to meet with them further shows you’re genuinely interested, so if you’re serious about doing research, make the time to meet with them. Mention that you’d like to meet with them in your email!
* Always attach your resume.
* Consider having at least browsed through a few of the professor/lab’s work beforehand. This gives you an idea of what sort of methods they use in their labs, what kind of work you might be expected to work. Additionally, looking through their research papers/lab websites often gives you names of graduate students that you can contact for further experience at what working at the lab is like. 
Q: Can I get academic credit for research? 
Yes! If the professor is in the Computer Science department, these credits (with a limit of usually 6, but it depends on the track) can be used toward track requirements!
Q: How do I get my research funded?
At Barnard: Con Edison Summer Internships in Science
http://barnard.edu/cd/students/funding/specialized/coned
* Applications are accepted early spring and summer;
* $1050 for a semester of research, or $4200 for summer with housing
* Requires a poster/powerpoint presentation at the end of each semester/summer of funding
* Research lab/internship MUST be located in NYC
At Barnard: Alumnae and Donor Sponsored Internship Grant
http://barnard.edu/cd/students/funding/internship-grants
* Applications accepted early fall, spring, and summer
* $800 during the semester, or $2000 for summer with housing (if at NYC)
* Research lab/internship can be located anywhere
Q: Work-Study
In addition to getting research grants, one way to fund your research is to be paid through work-study. As a student on financial aid, you might be required to hold a work-study job anyway. If this is the case and you’d like for your research to count as work-study instead, absolutely bring this up to your professor advisor! If it’s during the school year, the process is much more straightforward and follows the normal process of getting a work-study job. If you’re looking for a summer position, however, the work-study period doesn’t begin until July 1st. 
Work-study also allows you the opportunity to have your work-study job give you experience and insight on your future goals. This can include web development, database development, IT, or research, as mentioned in the previous section. Not only can this be a useful experience, but these jobs usually pay well, which means having to work fewer hours and having more time to focus on other things.

Q:Introductory Classes
If you’re interested in Computer Science, you should take one of the first five courses as soon as possible to see if you want to continue with the major. To complement that knowledge, consider applying to the fifth course, Emerging Scholars Program. If possible, take them first semester.
Q: COMS W1002 - Computing in Context
Common Name: “Ten Oh Two,” or “Computing in Context”
Notes: If you’re not an engineer and you don’t think you want to major in Computer Science, 1002 might be a good option. Engineers or possible CS majors should instead start with 1004 or 1006. This class is intended for non-majors.
Q: COMS W1004 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java 
Common Name: “Ten Oh Four,” or “Java”
Notes: This class should be your default choice if you want to be a Computer Science major. It gives a strong foundation in Computer Science and serves as a prerequisite for Data Structures.
Q: COMS W1005 - Intro to Computer Science and Programming in MatLab
Common Name: “Ten Oh Five”
Notes: This class is typically for non-majors needed to complete their computer science requirement and is not typically offered every semester. This course has not been offered in several years.
Q: ENGI E1006 - Introduction to Computing for Engineers and Applied Scientists
Common Name: “Ten Oh Six,” or “Python”
Notes: Python is a really useful language to know, especially if you’re considering a different field in engineering other than Computer Science. If you’re certain that you want to be a Computer Science major, 1004 and 1007 give a stronger introduction to the field of Computer Science, where 1006 is more of an introduction to programming. This is a requirement for a SEAS Computer Science majors, but not GS, BC, or CC.
Q: COMS W1007 - Honors Introduction to Computer Science
Common Name: “Ten Oh Seven,” or “Honors Java”
Notes: 1007 is a fantastic class to take, but only if you have past experience in Java. While some students choose to skip both 1004 and 1007 (and go straight to Data Structures) if they have Java experience (e.g. got a 5 in AP Computer Science), such students should consider taking 1007 anyway. This class teaches good programming practices and idioms, which many students never learn formally. Many 1007 students say that the material helped them in their jobs and internships.
Other Notes: This class is only offered fall semesters. 
Q: COMS W1404 - Emerging Scholars Program
Common Name: “ESP”
Notes: ESP is a weekly seminar that is designed to complement the material in the above 4 classes. Each week surveys a different area in advanced CS and gives students an idea of what they can look forward to later on in the major. Applications are open during the first week of classes each semester and will be advertised in W1004 and W1006. To learn more, visit: http://www.cs.columbia.edu/esp/
Q: Computer Science Core Classes
While most students end up taking these classes in the first two to three years, it’s totally fine to leave a class until senior year if it isn’t necessary for taking higher level classes. Note that we list “Useful Preparation” instead of “Prerequisites,” in order to convey what knowledge is strictly necessary for the course. Note that these may differ from the official prerequisites. Check out COMS W3134, COMS W3136, COMS W3137, COMS W3157, COMS W3203, COMS W3261, CSEE W3827, and STAT W4001.
